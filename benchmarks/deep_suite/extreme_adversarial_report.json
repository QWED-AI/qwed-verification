Now we need to find the probability that the car is behind door 2 specifically.\n\nGiven that you picked door 1 and the host opened door 3 (showing a goat), the car must be behind one of: door 1, door 2, or door 4.\n\nUsing Bayesian reasoning:\n- P(car at door 1) = 1/4 initially, and this doesn&#x27;t change = 1/4\n- P(car at door 2, 3, or 4) = 3/4 initially\n\nSince door 3 is revealed to have a goat, the car must be at door 2 or door 4 (if not at door 1). The probability 3/4 is now split between doors 2 and 4.\n\nBy symmetry (the host could have opened either door 3 or the other goat door), doors 2 and 4 are equally likely given the information revealed.\n\nThe remaining probability of 3/4 splits equally: P(car at door 2) = 3/8 and P(car at door 4) = 3/8.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. After the host opens door 3, we condition on this information. The probability that door 2 has the car, given you picked door 1 and host opened door 3, equals 1/2 of the switching probability benefit. Since doors 2 and 4 are symmetric after door 3 is opened, P(car at door 2 | picked 1, opened 3) = 1/2 * (2/3) = 1/3... \n\nActually, in the 4-door case: P(door 2 specifically) = 1/2 when choosing between the two remaining unopened doors you didn&#x27;t pick.",

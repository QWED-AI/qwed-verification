TESTING CLAUDE SONNET 4.5 & OPUS 4.5 WITH ADVERSARIAL PROBLEMS
================================================================================

I built a formal verification system to test top-tier LLMs.

TEST SUITE:
  - MEDIUM-HARD: 32 tests
  - EXTREME: 0 tests
  - TOTAL: 32 adversarial problems

TESTED AREAS:
  - Logic puzzles (Knights & Knaves, Tower of Hanoi)
  - Probability paradoxes (Monty Hall variants, Bayesian reasoning)
  - Nested quantifiers and multi-step proofs
  - Graph theory (isomorphism, Hamiltonian paths)
  - Number theory and combinatorics
  - Complex arithmetic and constraint satisfaction

RESULTS:
  Issues detected across difficulty levels
  EXTREME tests caught: 0 errors

KEY INSIGHT:
  Even state-of-the-art LLMs need formal verification for:
  - Enterprise deployment
  - Mission-critical systems
  - Compliance & auditability
  - Trust & reliability

This isn't about LLMs being 'bad' - it's about building reliable AI systems.

# QWED Business Strategy & Go-to-Market Plan

## 🎯 Value Proposition
**"Trust, Verified."**
QWED is not a chatbot. It is a **Deterministic Verification Engine** that sits on top of LLMs to ensure accuracy, logic, and security. We sell **reliability** in an unreliable AI world.

## 🏭 Target Industries & Use Cases

### 1. EdTech & E-Learning (Engines 1 & 2)
*   **Pain Point**: LLM tutors hallucinate math answers and logic steps.
*   **QWED Solution**:
    *   **Math Verifier**: Automatically grade student answers with 100% precision.
    *   **Logic Verifier**: Check step-by-step reasoning in STEM subjects.
*   **Ideal Client**: Khan Academy, Coursera, Chegg, Internal L&D platforms.

### 2. Finance & Auditing (Engines 1 & 3)
*   **Pain Point**: Analysts spend hours verifying numbers in reports against raw data.
*   **QWED Solution**:
    *   **Stats Verifier**: Upload a CSV (Earnings Report) and verify claims like "Revenue grew 15% YoY".
    *   **Math Verifier**: Double-check complex risk calculations generated by AI.
*   **Ideal Client**: Bloomberg, Deloitte, Hedge Funds, Fintech dashboards.

### 3. Legal & Compliance (Engines 2 & 4)
*   **Pain Point**: "Hallucinated precedents" and contradictory contract clauses.
*   **QWED Solution**:
    *   **Fact Verifier (RAG)**: Verify claims against a specific contract or case file (Citation-backed).
    *   **Logic Verifier**: Detect logical contradictions in policy documents (e.g., "Clause A says X, but Clause B implies Not X").
*   **Ideal Client**: LegalTech firms (Ironclad, Harvey), Compliance officers.

### 4. Enterprise Software & DevOps (Engine 5)
*   **Pain Point**: AI coding assistants generate insecure code (SQLi, Secrets).
*   **QWED Solution**:
    *   **Code Security Verifier**: Real-time firewall for AI-generated code. Blocks `eval`, hardcoded keys, and malicious patterns before they reach production.
*   **Ideal Client**: GitHub Copilot Enterprise users, Internal DevTools teams.

### 5. Business Intelligence (Engine 3)
*   **Pain Point**: "Chat with your Data" bots lie about the data.
*   **QWED Solution**:
    *   **Stats Verifier**: Ensure the text summary matches the actual table data.
*   **Ideal Client**: Tableau, PowerBI integrations, Salesforce.

## 🚫 What QWED is NOT (Scope Definition)
*To be clearly stated on the Frontend/Docs*

1.  **Not a Creative Writer**: Do not use QWED to write poems, marketing copy, or emails. We verify facts; we don't generate fluff.
2.  **Not a General Search Engine**: We verify against *provided* context or data. We don't browse the live web (yet).
3.  **Not a Medical/Life-Safety Device**: Do not use for medical diagnosis or autonomous driving verification.
4.  **Not a "Chatbot"**: We are a **Verification Layer**. You send us a query + context, we return a Verdict (True/False/Unsafe).

---

## 🔮 Roadmap: "Coming Soon"

1.  **Visual Verification (Engine 6)**: Verify claims about charts and images (e.g., "Does the graph show an upward trend?").
2.  **Web Search Verifier**: Verify claims against live web sources (Perplexity-style verification).
3.  **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs for critical code (beyond static analysis).
4.  **Batch Auditing**: Upload 1,000 documents and get a "Truth Score" report.

## 🔌 API Access Model

**Recommendation: "Unified Gateway, Modular Billing"**

### The "Holistic" Endpoint (Router)
*   **Endpoint**: `POST /verify/auto`
*   **Behavior**: User sends a query, QWED's `TranslationLayer` automatically routes it to the best engine (Math, Logic, or Stats).
*   **Pros**: Easiest integration for general-purpose AI assistants.

### The "Specialized" Endpoints (Power Users)
*   **Endpoints**: `/verify/math`, `/verify/logic`, `/verify/stats`, `/verify/fact`, `/verify/code`.
*   **Behavior**: Client explicitly chooses the engine.
*   **Pros**: Lower latency, predictable pricing, specific input schemas (e.g., CSV for stats).

### Pricing Strategy
*   **Tiered by Engine Complexity**:
    *   **Basic**: Math & Logic (Cheap, CPU-bound).
    *   **Pro**: Facts & Code (LLM-heavy, higher value).
    *   **Enterprise**: Stats (Sandboxed execution, high resource usage).

### Documentation Strategy
*   **Single SDK**: `npm install @qwed/sdk`
*   **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    import { Qwed } from '@qwed/sdk';
    const qwed = new Qwed('API_KEY');

    // Auto-routing
    await qwed.verify("What is 15% of 200?");

    // Explicit
    await qwed.stats.verify({ file: csv, query: "Total sales?" });
    ```
